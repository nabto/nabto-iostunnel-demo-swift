# Nabto Tunnel Demo in Swift

Empty app that just demonstrates the necessary plumbing and API
interaction necessary to use the Nabto Client SDK's tunnel API from
Swift. For now the app just logs to stdout and does nothing interesting at
all with the opened tunnel.

## Installation

The app uses the NabtoClient Cocoapod, so to build and run, perform the following steps:

1. Install dependencies: `$ pod install` (see https://www.cocoapods.org for info on installation of the pod tool)

2. Open the generated workspace in XCode and work from there: `open NabtoTunnelSwiftExample.xcworkspace`

If you see odd errors from Cocoapods, try upgrading to a reasonably new version (problems observed with 1.0.x, while 1.2.0 works fine).
